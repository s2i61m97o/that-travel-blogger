  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Define Your Travel Style</h3>
      <p>
        Why it's important: Knowing if you prefer fast-paced city hopping, lazy
        beach days, budget backpacking, or luxury resorts will guide all your
        other decisions—from destination to accommodation and activities. It
        stops you from planning a trip you won't actually enjoy.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Set a Realistic Budget</h3>
      <p>
        Why it's important: Money matters! Establishing a clear budget before
        you start booking helps you filter out destinations and experiences that
        are out of your price range, preventing overspending and financial
        stress during your trip.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Choose the Right Travel Time</h3>
      <p>
        Why it's important: Traveling during peak season can mean huge crowds
        and higher prices, while the off-season might mean better deals but
        closed attractions or bad weather. Researching the best time to visit
        your chosen spot is key to a great experience.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Book Flights and Accommodation Early</h3>
      <p>
        Why it's important: The sooner you book, the better the prices and
        selection! This is especially true for popular destinations and peak
        travel times. Leaving it to the last minute can seriously limit your
        options and inflate costs.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Research Visa and Entry Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        Why it's important: Nothing derails a trip faster than being denied
        boarding or entry! Every country has different rules. Checking well in
        advance ensures you have all the necessary documents, like passports
        (with enough validity!) and visas, ready to go.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Plan the First Few Days, But Not Everything</h3>
      <p>
        Why it's important: Having your arrival and first couple of days sorted
        (transport from the airport, first hotel check-in) removes stress after
        a long journey. However, leaving the rest of the itinerary open allows
        for spontaneity, local tips, and adapting to how you feel once you're
        there.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Look into Travel Insurance</h3>
      <p>
        Why it's important: Think of it as your safety net. Travel insurance
        covers the unexpected—like cancelled flights, lost luggage, or medical
        emergencies abroad. It’s the peace of mind you hope you never have to
        use, but will be eternally grateful for if you do.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Digitize Important Documents</h3>
      <p>
        Why it's important: Keep copies of your passport, flight confirmations,
        insurance details, and visa documents stored securely in the cloud or in
        a digital folder on your phone. If your physical wallet or bag gets
        lost, you'll still have access to the essentials.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Learn a Few Local Phrases</h3>
      <p>
        Why it's important: A simple "hello," "thank you," and "where is the
        bathroom" in the local language shows respect and can genuinely improve
        your interactions with locals. It makes the travel experience richer and
        more rewarding.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Research Local Transportation</h3>
      <p>
        Why it's important: Knowing how you’ll get around—whether it's using the
        metro, local buses, ride-shares, or taxis—saves time and money.
        Pre-downloading necessary apps or buying transit cards can make your
        movements much smoother when you arrive.
