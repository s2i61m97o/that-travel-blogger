## What I have learnt

Even using libraries such as Bootstrap 5 it is not as simple as copying code into a project. When I had set up the image carousel for my blogposts, the carousel would stretch the images to the maximum height and width allowed when scrolling through the images, before resetting them to the correct size. Upon solving that problem, the images would scroll to one side of the screen before recentering themselves. It took a little bit of research and playing around to fix the problem.
