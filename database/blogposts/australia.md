Our adventure kicked off in Sydney, a city that immediately grabs you with its vibrant energy. We spent a few days exploring the Harbour Bridge, taking in an opera house performance, and getting lost (in a good way!) in the charming laneways. The food scene? Absolutely incredible. And let's not forget the beaches – Bondi and Manly were just as stunning as the postcards promised.
Leaving Sydney, we headed north, and that's when the "sunburnt coast" truly began to reveal itself. Our first major stop was Byron Bay, and oh my goodness, what a gem! The laid-back atmosphere, incredible surf, and bohemian vibe instantly won us over. We spent our days catching waves, exploring the lighthouse, and enjoying delicious acai bowls. If you're looking to truly unwind, Byron is your spot.
Further up the coast, we ventured into the lush, ancient Daintree Rainforest, which felt like stepping into another world. The sheer scale and biodiversity here are astounding. We took a guided walk, learning about the incredible plant and animal life, and even spotted a cassowary! It's a humbling experience to be surrounded by such ancient natural beauty.

And, of course, no East Coast trip is complete without a visit to the Great Barrier Reef. We booked a snorkeling trip from Cairns, and it was simply breathtaking. The vibrant colours of the coral, the schools of fish, and even a few friendly sea turtles made for an unforgettable experience. It's a powerful reminder of the incredible natural wonders we need to protect.

This journey up the East Coast was more than just a series of destinations; it was an immersion into the diverse heart of Australia. From the bustling cities to the tranquil beaches and ancient rainforests, every stop offered a unique glimpse into this incredible country. If you're dreaming of an adventure, I highly recommend adding the Sunburnt Coast to your bucket list. You won't regret it!
